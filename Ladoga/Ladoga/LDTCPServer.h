/**
 Class that implements base TCP server. Actually you don't need to use this class since you want to run an HTTP server. Use `LDHTTPServer` class, which inherits `LDTCPServer` and provides required functionality.
 
 ## Initialization
 
 Use `initWithAddress:andPort:` method to initialize TCP server:
 
    id tcpServer = [[LDTCPServer alloc] initWithAddress:@"127.0.0.1" andPort:8080];
 
 You are able to change it's address and port throug the appropriate properties, but keep in mind that it is possible only before server is running.
 
 ## Listening For New Connections
 
 When `LDTCPServer` runs, it starts listening for new connections from clients' software. Once new connection established, server invokes the `acceptConnection:` method of `LDTCPServerDelegate`. That means that new connection is accepted and ready to data exchanging. To handle this connection, you should implement `LDTCPServerDelegate` protocol in one of your classes, and after that you should assign your delegate to `delegate` property of `LDTCPServer` instance.
 
 ## Server Running
 
 When you have created an instance of `LDTCPServerDelegate` and set it's delegate, you can run server calling `startWithRunLoop:` method. To stop server just call `stop` method.
